# YEN | VPA Prompt and Report Generator

A tool for fetching Volume Price Analysis (VPA) data, generating prompts for analysis, and producing reports with the help of OpenAIâ€™s GPT models. It allows you to analyze stock data over different time intervals (1-hour, 1-day, 1-week) and generate reports that are formatted in Markdown and HTML.

## Features
- **Prompt Generator**: Fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance and creates a prompt for GPT to analyze the data based on volume-price relationships and other VPA criteria.
- **Report Generator**: Converts the GPT-generated analysis into a Markdown report and then converts it into HTML for easy copy-paste into Word or other document formats.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HawtStrokes/yen.git
   cd yen
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional, but Recommended)**

   If you prefer to work with a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**

   Make sure you have pip installed, and then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a config.json File**

   Create a `config.json` file in the root directory of this repository with your OpenAI API key:
   ```json
   {
       "openai_api_key": "<YOUR API KEY>"
   }
   ```
   Note: Replace `<YOUR API KEY>` with your actual OpenAI API key. This is required to interact with the OpenAI API.

## Usage Instructions

Run the Script to Fetch Data and Generate Reports

The script can be run with the following command:
```bash
python main.py <TICKER> <START_DATE> <END_DATE> --intervals <INTERVALS>
```
- `<TICKER>`: The stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL).
- `<START_DATE>`: The start date for the data (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- `<END_DATE>`: The end date for the data (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- `--intervals`: Optional. List of candlestick intervals. Default is `1h 1d 1wk`.

Example:
```bash
python main.py AAPL 2023-01-01 2023-12-31 --intervals 1h 1d 1wk
```

## Output

The script will generate a report in HTML format and save it with the following naming convention:
```php
vpa_analysis_<TICKER>_<START_DATE>_<END_DATE>.html
```
This file can be opened in any browser, and you can copy and paste the contents into a Word document.

## Token Limit and Considerations

The OpenAI models used have token limits, which may affect the amount of data you can process in one request.
- **GPT-3.5 (4096 tokens)**: The model has a token limit of 4096 tokens (input + output). If the token limit is exceeded, the input will need to be shortened.
- **GPT-4**: You can use GPT-4 models with token limits up to 32K tokens, but ensure you are using the correct model version and that your OpenAI API key supports this.

Important: This project uses the OpenAI API, so ensure that you have an active API key in your `config.json` file.
